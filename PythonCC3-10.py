# 3-10. Every Function: Think of something you could store in a list. For example,
# you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything
# else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items
# and then uses each function introduced in this chapter at least once.

# Bleh. I don't want to do this but fine. A bit of a pain in the arse.
