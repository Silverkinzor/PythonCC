# 4-10. Slices: Using one of the programs you wrote in this chapter, add several
# lines to the end of the program that do the following:

# Print the message, The first three items in the list are:. Then use a slice to
# print the first three items from that programâ€™s list.

# Print the message, Three items from the middle of the list are:. Use a slice
# to print three items from the middle of the list.

# Print the message, The last three items in the list are:. Use a slice to print
# the last three items in the list.

# Using PythonCC4-09
