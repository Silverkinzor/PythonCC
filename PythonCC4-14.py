# 4-14. PEP 8: Look through the original PEP 8 style guide at https://python.org/
# dev/peps/pep-0008/. You wonâ€™t use much of it now, but it might be interesting
# to skim through it.

# 4 spaces or 1 tab per indentation level...

# try to limit each line size to less than 80 characters...

# use blank lines to help organize code...

# write long lists like this:

# long_list = [ '1', '2', '3'
#               '4', '5', '6'
#               '7', '8', '9' ]

# imports on separate lines...

# use block comments before the block...

# use inline comments sparingly...

# (yeah, I should follow the above guidelines when using comments)

# don't use single character variables 'l' and 'o' as they can be mistaken for '1's and '0's

# etc.

# Either all return statements in a function should return an expression, or none of them should...
# return None
