# 5-13. Your Ideas: At this point, you’re a more capable programmer than you
# were when you started this book. Now that you have a better sense of how
# real-world situations are modeled in programs, you might be thinking of some
# problems you could solve with your own programs. Record any new ideas you
# have about problems you might want to solve as your programming skills continue
# to improve. Consider games you might want to write, data sets you might
# want to explore, and web applications you’d like to create.
