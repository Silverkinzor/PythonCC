# 6-12. Extensions: Weâ€™re now working with examples that are complex enough
# that they can be extended in any number of ways. Use one of the example programs
# from this chapter, and extend it by adding new keys and values, changing
# the context of the program or improving the formatting of the output.

# But I've already been doing this since the beginning of the book...
# I'll just do the suggested extension I saw on pg. 113
